config:
  options:
    coordinator_runs_workload_when_clustered:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: |
        Whether this charm should also run a worker node when related
        to any number of specialized worker applications.
        
        Set it to ``false`` if you want this charm to stop running `Tempo` 
        as soon as you integrate it with a tempo-worker-k8s-charm instance. 
        In this case, tempo-k8s will only act as coordinator 
        (and reverse proxy) for the tempo cluster.
